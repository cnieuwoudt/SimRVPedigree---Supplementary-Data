# PopulationPedData
This is a .txt fomatted data set that provides the summarized familial rare-variant segregation data discussed in *Results: Applications: Proportion of Ascertained Pedigrees Segregating a Causal Variant*.

The variables included in this data set are described as follows:
1. GRR: genetic relative-risk for carriers of the rare causal variant.
2. p_c: carrier probabilty of the causal variant
3. n_2: number of pedigrees ascertained with 2 or more disease-affected relatives
4. g_2: number of pedigrees segregating a causal varaint with 2 or more disease-affected relatives
5. n_3: number of pedigrees ascertained with 3 or more disease-affected relatives
6. g_3: number of pedigrees segregating a causal varaint with 3 or more disease-affected relatives
7. n_4: number of pedigrees ascertained with 4 or more disease-affected relatives
8. g_4: number of pedigrees segregating a causal varaint with 4 or more disease-affected relatives
9. n_5: number of pedigrees ascertained with 5 or more disease-affected relatives
10 g_5: number of pedigrees segregating a causal varaint with 5 or more disease-affected relatives
