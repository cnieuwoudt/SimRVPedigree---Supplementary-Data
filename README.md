# RVPedDat
This is a .txt formatted data set that provides the summarized familial data discussed in "Simulating Pedigrees Ascertained for Multiple Disease Affected Relatives."

The variables included in this data set are described as follows:
1. FamID: family identification number
2. ID: individual identification number
3. GRR: genetic relative-risk of disease
4. RVstatus: rare-variant status
5. onsetAge: age of disease-onset
6. aveIBD: average of the pair-wise IBD probabilities for the disease-affected relatives in a single pedigree.
   
# PopRVSegDat
This is a .txt fomatted data set that provides the summarized familial rare-variant segregation data discussed in *Results: Applications: Proportion of Ascertained Pedigrees Segregating a Causal Variant*.

The variables included in this data set are described as follows:
1. GRR: genetic relative-risk for carriers of the rare causal variant.
2. p_c: carrier probabilty of the causal variant
3. n_2: number of pedigrees ascertained with 2 or more disease-affected relatives
4. g_2: number of pedigrees segregating a causal varaint with 2 or more disease-affected relatives
5. n_3: number of pedigrees ascertained with 3 or more disease-affected relatives
6. g_3: number of pedigrees segregating a causal varaint with 3 or more disease-affected relatives
7. n_4: number of pedigrees ascertained with 4 or more disease-affected relatives
8. g_4: number of pedigrees segregating a causal varaint with 4 or more disease-affected relatives
9. n_5: number of pedigrees ascertained with 5 or more disease-affected relatives
10 g_5: number of pedigrees segregating a causal varaint with 5 or more disease-affected relatives

# FollowUpDat
This is a .txt fomatted data set that includes
